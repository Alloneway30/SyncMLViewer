Modify the SyncMLViewer.csproj file manually and add EmbeddedResource with $(Configuration) variable in path:

```xml
 <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="..\SyncMLViewer.Executer\bin\x64\$(Configuration)\SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe">
      <Link>SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe</Link>
    </EmbeddedResource>
 </ItemGroup>
```

Manual way:
------------
To embedd SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe into the SyncMLViewer.exe, you need to copy the 
SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe (show all files in SyncMLViewer.Executer project) into the SyncMLViewer project root via "Paste as Link".

Then on Properties of the SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe, set "Build Action" to "Embedded Resource" and "Copy to Output Directory" to "Do not copy".
The Filename must be "SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe" (without path).

Be sure that the Release Version of SyncMLViewer includes the Release Version of SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe. Can be seen easily in the 
path ...x64\Release\SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe, not the Debug Version.

For Debug build remove the Link to the Release Version of SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe and add the Debug Version of SyncMLViewer.Executer.exe 
and change the properties accordingly to "Embedded Resource".

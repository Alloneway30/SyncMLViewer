# SyncMLViewer

A small real time SyncML protocol Viewer. Helping during troubleshooting to see what is the client actually receiving. Verifying OMA-URIs and data field definitions. 

inspired by the blog post from Michael Niehaus about real time troubleshooting with Message Analyzer I thought it might be handy to have a simple tool dedicated for that purpose to watch the SyncML protocol in real time.
